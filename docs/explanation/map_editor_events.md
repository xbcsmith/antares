# Map Egit stditor Events

I am manually testing the Events in Map Editor and I think we have a lot of gaps for a good UX experience. I will try to list them.

## General

I want some type of hinting system for entering values. For example, if I am entering a number, I want to see what the valid range is. If I am entering a string, I want to see if there are any restrictions on the string (like length or allowed characters). Example when entering a group of monsters, I want to see what monsters are available to choose from. I don't want a bunch of labels I want a dropdown or a searchable list.

## Trap Events

- Effects should be conditions. So we should look up the condition list and see if we can add more conditions.
