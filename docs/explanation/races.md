Key descriptive characteristics and mechanical limitations defined these races in the 1st Edition rules:
AD&D 1st Edition Race Descriptions and Mechanics
Rather than a simple description table, the game presented races with specific ability score requirements, bonuses/penalties, and class limitations. A central feature was the "race as class" mechanic in the Basic/Expert sets and class restrictions in AD&D, where non-human characters often had level limits in certain classes.

    Dwarves
        Description: Short, stout, hardy, and known for their skill in mining, stone-working, and combat. They are often stubborn and value ale and craftsmanship.
        Mechanics: Required minimum ability scores (e.g., Constitution 9+), received a +1 Constitution bonus and -1 Charisma penalty, and were limited to classes like Fighter, Thief, or Cleric (with level limits). They had special abilities like infravision and detecting secret doors.
    Elves
        Description: Tall, slender, mysterious, and often seen as elegant or elitist. They are strongly connected to nature and magic.
        Mechanics: Required minimum Intelligence of 9+. They could multi-class (e.g., Fighter/Magic-User/Thief) but generally had level advancement limitations. They were immune to ghoul paralysis and had infravision.
    Gnomes
        Description: Smaller than dwarves, known for their curiosity, intelligence, and love of tinkering and illusion magic. Often lived in forest environments.
        Mechanics: Had specific class options and abilities related to illusion magic and engineering.
    Half-Elves
        Description: Often prejudiced against, they possessed a blend of human adaptability and elven traits.
        Mechanics: Could choose from a wider range of classes and multi-class combinations than pure elves or humans (except for Paladin/Cavalier) but faced some level caps.
    Halflings
        Description: Similar to hobbits; folksy, quick-fingered, and fond of comfortable living. They were often considered "tricksy".
        Mechanics: Small-sized, limited to Fighter and Thief classes, and had specific ability score requirements. They were known for their stealth and luck.
    Half-Orcs
        Description: Large, brutish in appearance, but with varying personalities. They often faced social stigma.
        Mechanics: Received a bonus to Strength and Constitution but a penalty to Intelligence and Charisma. They were restricted in class choice and had level limits.
    Humans
        Description: Highly adaptable, ambitious, and diverse, without the inherent biases or physical limitations of other races.
        Mechanics: Humans were unique because they could choose any single class and advance without any level restrictions, making them superior for high-level play. They did not have the ability score bonuses/penalties or special immunities other races received

 Races have specific ability score adjustments, as shown in a sample table. For example, Dwarves get a \(+1\) Constitution and \(-1\) Charisma, while Elves get \(+1\) Dexterity and \(-1\) Constitution. Humans receive no bonuses or penalties, and races like Gnomes, Half-Elves, and Half-Orcs also have their own unique sets of adjustments and restrictions.

Race Ability Adjustments

Dwarf +1 Constitution; -1 Charisma
Elf +1 Dexterity; -1 Constitution
Gnome +1 Intelligence; -1 Wisdom
Halfling +1 Dexterity; -1 Strength
Half-Elf No racial ability score adjustments
Human No racial ability score adjustments
Half-Orc +1 Strength; -1 Intelligence
