# SPELL DATA


## SPELL EXPLANATIONS

The spell is first identified by name and type of magic it involves. Thereafter its level,
range (distance it can be cast), duration, area of effect, components, cast-
ing time, and saving throw are shown. Finally, an explanation of the spell
and a description of its effects are given in some detail.

Range is shown in inches (See DISTANCE) or as "touch", which indicates
the caster must physically contact the recipient of the spell with his or her
hand.

Duration is given as number of turns, rounds, or simply"instantaneous", as
in the case of a lightning bolt which lasts only a brief moment. (See TIME.)

Area of Effect shows how large an area the spell covers, or how many
persons or creatures it will affect.

Components, as previously mentioned, are verbal (V), somatic (S),and/or
material (M). This indicates which ore part of the spell.

Saving Throw tells whether a saving throw is possible, and if it is possible,
whether success negates (neg.) the spell or reduces its effects by 50% (%)

## Cleric Spell Example

### bless (Conjuration/Summoning) Reversible

Level: 1
Range: 6"
Duration: 6 melee rounds
Area of Effect: 5 X 5
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 round
Saving Throw: None
Explanation/Description: Upon uttering the bless spell, the caster raises the dice rolls by +l.
Furthermore, it raises their "to hit" morale of friendly creatures by +l.
A blessing, however, will affect only those not already engaged in melee combat. This spell can be reversed by the cleric to a
curse upon enemies which lowers morale and "to hit" by -1. The caster
determines at what range (up to 6") he or she will cast the spell, and it
then affects all creatures in an area 5" square centered on the point the
spell was cast upon. In addition to the verbal and somatic gesture
components, the bless requires holy water, while the curse requires the
sprinkling of specially polluted water.

## Magic-User Spell Example

### Fireball (Evocation)

Level: 3
Range: 10" + 1"/level
Duration: Instantaneous
Area of Effect: 2"radius sphere
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 3 segments
Saving Throw: 1/2

Explanation/Description: A fireball is an explosive burst of flame, which
detonates with a low roar, and delivers damage proportionate to the level
of the magic-user who cast it, i.e. 1 six-sided die (d6) for each level of
experience of the spell caster. Exception: Magic fireball wands deliver 6
die fireballs (6d6), magic staves with this capability deliver 8 die fireballs,
and scroll spells of this type deliver a fireball of from 5 to 10 dice (d64)
of damage. The burst of the fireball does not expend a considerable
amount of pressure, and the burst will generally conform to the shape of
the area in which it occurs, thus covering an area equal to its normal
spherical volume. [The area which is covered by the fireball is a total
volume of roughly 33,000 cubic feet (or yards)]. Besides causing damage
to creatures, the fireball ignites all combustible materials within its burst
radius, and the heat of the fireball will melt soft metals such as gold,
copper, silver, etc. Items exposed to the spell's effects must be rolled for to
determine if they are affected. Items with a creature which makes its
saving throw are considered as unaffected. The magic-u,ser points his or
her finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball
is to borst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless i t impacts
upon a material body prior to attaining the prescribed range, flowers into
the fireball If creatures fail their saving throws, they all take full hit point
damage frqm the blast. Those who make saving throws manage to dodge,
fall flat or roll aside, taking '/1 the full hit point damage - each and every
one within the blast area. The material component of this spell is a tiny
ball composed of bat guano and sulphur.

### Sleep (Enchantment/Charm)

Level: I
Range: 3" + 1"/level
Duration: 5 rounds/level
Area of Effect: Special
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 1 round
Saving Throw: None

Explanation/Description: By means of a read magic spell, the magic-user
is able to read magical inscriptions on objects - books, scrolls, weapons
and the like - which would otherwise be totally unintelligible to him or
her. (The personal books of the magic-user, and works already magically
read, are intelligible.) This deciphering does not normally invoke the
magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the caseof a curse
scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and the magic-user hos read the
magical inscription, he or she is thereafter able to read that particular
writing without recourse to the use of the read magic spell. The durotion of
the spell is 2 rounds per level of experience of the spell caster. The
material component for the spell is a clear crystal or mineral prism. Note
that the material is not expended by use. The reverse of the spell,
unreadable magic, makes such writing completely unreadable to any
creature, even with the aid of a read magic, until the spell wears off or the
magic is dispelled. The material components for the reverse spell are a
pinch of dirt ond a drop of water.
Components: V, S,M
Costing Time: I segment
Saving Throw: None
Explanation/Description: When a magic-user casts a sleep spell, he or she
will usually cause a comatose slumber to come upon one or more
creatures [other than undead and certain other creatures specifically
excluded (see ADVANCED DUNGEONS 8 DRAGONS, MONSTER
MANUAL) from the spell's effects]. All creotures to be affected by the
sleep spell must be within a 3" diameter circle. The number of creatures
which can be affected is a function of their life energy levels, expressed os
hit dice and hit points:
Creatures
Hit Dice
up to 1
1 + 1 to2
24-1 to3
3+1 to4
4+1 to4+4
Number Affected
By Sleep Spell
4-16
(4d4)
2-8
(2d4)
1-4
(ld4)
1-2
(Yzd4, round off)
0-1
(d4,3 or4)
The area of effect is determined by the range and area center decided
upon by the spell caster. Slopping or wounding will awaken affected
creatures, but noise will not do so. Awakening requires 1 complete melee
round. Note that sleeping creatures con be slain automatically at a rote of
1 per slayer per melee round. The material component for this spell is o
pinch of fine sand, rose petols, or a live cricket.
