# NPC Sprite Sheet Generation Prompts

This document contains AI image generation prompts for the NPCs defined in `campaigns/tutorial/data/npcs.ron`. These prompts are designed to generate pixel art sprite sheets suitable for Antares (32x48 pixel character base).

**Usage Guidelines:**
- **Model Recommendation**: DALL-E 3, Midjourney v6, or specialized Stable Diffusion pixel art models.
- **Post-Processing**: You will likely need to remove backgrounds (magent/white) and resize/align to the 32x48 grid using editing tools (see `docs/tutorials/creating_sprites.md`).
- **Style**: Classic 16-bit JRPG pixel art, 2.5D top-down perspective.
