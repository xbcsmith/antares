## Phase 1: Remove Per-Tile Event Triggers - COMPLETED

**Date:** 2025-01-XX
**Status:** ✅ Core implementation complete

### Summary

Successfully removed the deprecated `event_trigger: Option<EventId>` field from the `Tile` struct and consolidated all map event handling to use the position-based event system (`Map.events: HashMap<Position, MapEvent>`). This eliminates dual event representation and establishes a single source of truth for map events.

### Changes Made

#### Core Domain Changes

1. **`antares/src/domain/world/types.rs`**

   - Removed `pub event_trigger: Option<EventId>` field from `Tile` struct (L85)
   - Removed `event_trigger: None` initialization from `Tile::new()` (L114)
   - Removed unused `EventId` import
   - Added `Map::get_event_at_position()` helper method for explicit event lookup by position
   - Added unit tests:
     - `test_map_get_event_at_position_returns_event()` - verifies event retrieval
     - `test_map_get_event_at_position_returns_none_when_no_event()` - verifies None case

2. **`antares/src/domain/world/movement.rs`**

   - Deleted `trigger_tile_event()` function (L197-199) and its documentation (L191-196)
   - Removed obsolete tests:
     - `test_trigger_tile_event_none()`
     - `test_trigger_tile_event_exists()`

3. **`antares/src/domain/world/mod.rs`**
   - Removed `trigger_tile_event` from public module exports

#### Event System Integration

4. **`antares/src/game/systems/events.rs`**
   - Verified existing `check_for_events()` system already uses position-based lookup via `map.get_event(current_pos)` - no changes needed
   - Added comprehensive integration tests:
     - `test_event_triggered_when_party_moves_to_event_position()` - verifies events trigger on position match
     - `test_no_event_triggered_when_no_event_at_position()` - verifies no false triggers
     - `test_event_only_triggers_once_per_position()` - verifies events don't re-trigger when stationary

### Validation Results

All quality checks passed:

```bash
✅ cargo fmt --all                                          # Clean
✅ cargo check --all-targets --all-features                 # 0 errors
✅ cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings # 0 warnings
✅ cargo nextest run --all-features                         # 916/916 tests passed
```

Verification of `event_trigger` removal:

```bash
grep -r "\.event_trigger\|event_trigger:" src/ | wc -l
# Result: 0 (complete removal confirmed)
```

### Architecture Compliance

- ✅ No modification to core data structures beyond approved deletions
- ✅ Type system adherence maintained (Position-keyed HashMap)
- ✅ Module structure follows architecture.md Section 3.2
- ✅ Event dispatch uses single canonical model (Map.events)
- ✅ All public APIs have documentation with examples
- ✅ Test coverage >80% for new functionality

### Breaking Changes

This is a **breaking change** for any code that:

- Accesses `tile.event_trigger` directly
- Calls the removed `trigger_tile_event()` function
- Serializes/deserializes maps with `event_trigger` field in Tile

**Migration Path:** Event triggers should be defined in `Map.events` (position-keyed HashMap) instead of per-tile fields. The event system automatically queries events by position when the party moves.

### Next Steps

Phase 2 will handle:

- Map editor updates to use events list exclusively
- Migration tool for existing map RON files (remove `event_trigger: None` lines)
- Configuration/documentation updates
- Data file cleanup (tutorial campaign maps)

## Plan: Portrait IDs as Strings

TL;DR: Require portrait identifiers to be explicit strings (filename stems). Update domain types, HUD asset lookups, campaign data, and campaign validation to use and enforce string keys. This simplifies asset management and ensures unambiguous, filesystem-driven portrait matching.

**Steps (4 steps):**

1. Change domain types in [file](antares/src/domain/character_definition.rs) and [file](antares/src/domain/character.rs): convert `portrait_id` to `String` (`CharacterDefinition::portrait_id`, `Character::portrait_id`).
2. Simplify HUD logic in [file](antares/src/game/systems/hud.rs): remove numeric mapping and index portraits only by normalized filename stems (`PortraitAssets.handles_by_name`); lookups use `character.portrait_id` string key first then fallback to normalized `character.name`.
3. Require campaign data changes: update sample campaigns (e.g. `campaigns/tutorial/data/characters.ron`) and add validation (in `sdk/campaign_builder` / campaign loader) to reject non-string `portrait_id`.
4. Update tests and docs: adjust unit tests to use string keys, add new tests for name-key lookup + validation, and document the new format in `docs/reference` and `docs/how-to`.

Patch: Campaign-scoped asset root via BEVY_ASSET_ROOT and campaign-relative paths

TL;DR: Fixes runtime asset-loading and approval issues by making the campaign directory the effective Bevy asset root at startup. The binary sets `BEVY_ASSET_ROOT` to the (canonicalized) campaign root and configures `AssetPlugin.file_path = "."` so portrait files can be loaded using campaign-relative paths like `assets/portraits/15.png` (resolved against the campaign root). The HUD also includes defensive handling to avoid indexing transparent placeholder handles and defers applying textures until they are confirmed loaded, improving robustness and UX.

What changed:

- Code: `antares/src/bin/antares.rs` — at startup, the campaign directory is registered as a named `AssetSource` (via `AssetSourceBuilder::platform_default`) _before_ `DefaultPlugins` / the `AssetServer` are initialized.
- Code: `antares/src/game/systems/hud.rs` — portrait-loading robustness:
  - `ensure_portraits_loaded` now computes each portrait's path relative to the campaign root and attempts a normal `asset_server.load()` first. If the AssetServer refuses the path (returning `Handle::default()`), the system now tries `asset_server.load_override()` as a controlled fallback and logs a warning if both attempts fail.
  - The system does not index `Handle::default()` (the transparent placeholder) values; only non-default handles are stored so we don't inadvertently replace placeholders with transparent textures that will never render.
  - `update_portraits` defers applying a texture until the asset is actually available: it checks `AssetServer::get_load_state` (and also verifies presence in `Assets<Image>` in test environments) and continues to show the deterministic color placeholder until the image is loaded. This prevents the UI from displaying permanently blank portraits when an asset load is refused or still pending.
- Tests: Added/updated tests that:
  - Verify portraits are enumerated and indexed correctly from the campaign assets directory,
  - Exercise loaded-vs-placeholder behavior by inserting an Image into `Assets<Image>` (using a tiny inline image via `Image::new_fill`) so tests can assert the HUD switches from placeholder to image once the asset is considered present/loaded.
- Observability: Added debug and warning logs showing discovered portrait files, any unapproved/failed loads, and the campaign-scoped asset path used for loading.

Why this fixes the issue:

Previously, when the AssetServer refused to load an asset from an unapproved path it returned `Handle::default()` (a transparent image handle). The HUD code indexed those default handles and immediately applied them to the UI image node, which produced permanently blank portraits. By avoiding indexing default handles, trying `load_override()` only as a fallback, and only applying textures once they are confirmed loaded (or present in `Assets<Image>` for tests), the HUD preserves deterministic color placeholders until a real texture is available and logs clear warnings when loads fail.

Why this fixes the issue:
Bevy's asset loader forbids loading files outside of approved sources (default `UnapprovedPathMode::Forbid`), which caused absolute-path loads to be rejected and logged as "unapproved." By registering the campaign folder as an approved `AssetSource` and using the named source path form (`campaign_id://...`), the `AssetServer` treats these paths as approved and loads them correctly, while preserving the requirement that asset paths are relative to the campaign.

Developer notes:

- Backwards compatibility: Campaigns that place files under the global `assets/` directory continue to work.
- Runtime robustness: The HUD now avoids indexing default (transparent) handles returned by the AssetServer when a path is unapproved. It will attempt `load_override()` as a controlled fallback and will only apply textures once the asset is confirmed available (via `AssetServer::get_load_state`) or present in the `Assets<Image>` storage (useful for deterministic unit tests). Unit tests were updated to create inline `Image::new_fill` assets and explicitly initialize `Assets<Image>` in the test world to simulate a \"loaded\" asset.
- Security: We do not relax global unapproved-path handling; instead, we register campaign directories as approved sources at startup and use `load_override()` only as an explicit fallback when necessary.
- Future work: Consider adding end-to-end integration tests that exercise a live `AssetServer` instance loading real files via campaign sources, and document the CLI/config option for controlling source naming and approval behavior.

All local quality checks (formatting, clippy, and unit tests) were run and passed after the change.

**Decisions:**

1. Strict enforcement: Numeric `portrait_id` values will be rejected with a hard error during campaign validation. Campaign data MUST provide `portrait_id` as a string (filename stem); migration helpers or warnings are out-of-scope for this change.

2. Normalization: Portrait keys are normalized by lowercasing and replacing spaces with underscores when indexing and looking up assets (e.g., `"Sir Lancelot"` -> `"sir_lancelot"`).

3. Default value: When omitted, `portrait_id` defaults to an empty string (`""`) to indicate no portrait. The legacy `"0"` value is no longer used.

# Portrait IDs as Strings Implementation Plan

## Overview

Replace numeric portrait identifiers with explicit string identifiers (matching filename stems). Campaign authors will provide portrait keys as strings (example: `portrait_id: "kira"`) and the engine will match files in `assets/portraits/` by normalized stem. Validation will require string usage and will error on numeric form to avoid ambiguity.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure

- Domain types:
  - `CharacterDefinition::portrait_id: u8` ([file](antares/src/domain/character_definition.rs))
  - `Character::portrait_id: u8` ([file](antares/src/domain/character.rs))
- HUD / UI:
  - `PortraitAssets` currently includes `handles_by_id: HashMap<u8, Handle<Image>>` and `handles_by_name: HashMap<String, Handle<Image>>` ([file](antares/src/game/systems/hud.rs)).
  - `ensure_portraits_loaded` parses filenames and optionally indexes numeric stems.
  - `update_portraits` tries numeric lookup then name lookup.
- Campaign data:
  - `campaigns/tutorial/data/characters.ron` uses numeric `portrait_id` values.
- Tooling: Campaign editor exists under `sdk/campaign_builder` and currently allows/assumes `portrait_id` as strings in editor buffers, but validation is not strict.

### Identified Issues

- Mixed numeric/string handling adds complexity and ambiguity.
- Many characters default to numeric `0`, leading to identical placeholders.
- Lack of explicit validation means old numeric data silently works (or is partially tolerated); user wants to require explicit string format.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Implementation

#### 1.1 Foundation Work

- Change `CharacterDefinition::portrait_id` from `u8` -> `String` in [file](antares/src/domain/character_definition.rs) and update `CharacterDefinition::new` default.
- Change `Character::portrait_id` from `u8` -> `String` in [file](antares/src/domain/character.rs) and update `Character::new` default.
- Add/adjust model documentation comments to describe the new requirement.

#### 1.2 Add Foundation Functionality

- Update `PortraitAssets` in [file](antares/src/game/systems/hud.rs) to remove `handles_by_id` and only use `handles_by_name: HashMap<String, Handle<Image>>`.
- Update `ensure_portraits_loaded`:
  - Always index files by normalized stem (lowercase + underscores).
  - Do not attempt numeric parsing or special numeric mapping.
- Update `update_portraits`:
  - Use `character.portrait_id` (normalized) as first lookup key in `handles_by_name`.
  - Fallback to normalized `character.name` if no `portrait_id` key is found.
- Add debug logging around asset scanning and lookup for observability.

#### 1.3 Integrate Foundation Work

- Update all code that previously relied on numeric portrait indices.
- Remove or repurpose any helper maps or code paths used solely for numeric handling.
- Ensure `CharacterDefinition` deserialization expects strings (strict), so numeric values in campaign files will cause validation error.

#### 1.4 Testing Requirements

- Add unit tests for `ensure_portraits_loaded` to confirm indexing by normalized name keys.
- Add unit tests for `update_portraits` verifying lookup precedence and fallback.
- Update existing tests that use numeric literals (e.g., `portrait_id: 1`) to use string keys (e.g., `portrait_id: "1".to_string()` or more meaningful names).
- Add validation tests asserting that numeric `portrait_id` values in campaign RON fail validation (explicit error).

#### 1.5 Deliverables

- [] `CharacterDefinition` and `Character` updated to use `String`.
- [] HUD asset loading updated to name-only indexing.
- [] Validation logic added to campaign loader/editor to reject numeric `portrait_id`.
- [] Tests updated and new tests added.
- [] Documentation updated in `docs/reference` and sample campaigns updated.

#### 1.6 Success Criteria

- All unit tests pass.
- Engine fails campaign validation for any campaign that uses numeric `portrait_id`.
- Updated tutorial campaign (example) uses string portrait keys and HUD displays portraits accordingly.

### Phase 2: Campaign & Tooling Updates

#### 2.1 Feature Work

- Update the tutorial campaign `campaigns/tutorial/data/characters.ron` as the canonical example to use string portrait IDs.
- Update the `sdk/campaign_builder` editor UI to present/enforce a string input for portrait keys.

#### 2.2 Integrate Feature

- Add a validation routine in campaign loading/publishing to check:
  - `portrait_id` must be a non-empty string when present.
  - A matching file exists in `assets/portraits/` for `portrait_id`, or emit a clear validation error.

#### 2.3 Configuration Updates

- Update developer docs (new doc in `docs/how-to/portrait_naming.md`) describing:
  - required filename rules,
  - normalization policy (lowercase + underscores),
  - example entries and sample RON snippets.

#### 2.4 Testing requirements

- Integration test: Load a sample campaign with string portrait IDs and ensure HUD portraits render.
- Validation tests: Ensure campaigns with numeric `portrait_id` values raise validation errors.

#### 2.5 Deliverables

- [] Tutorial campaign updated to string keys.
- [] Campaign editor validation enforced in `sdk/campaign_builder`.
- [] Documentation and examples updated.

#### 2.6 Success Criteria

- Campaigns with string `portrait_id` load and display portraits correctly.
- Campaigns with numeric `portrait_id` fail validation with clear guidance to users.

This is a draft plan for review. I will NOT begin implementation until you confirm the plan and answer the open questions:

1. Strictly reject numeric `portrait_id` during validation? (Yes/No)
2. Confirm normalization: lowercase + underscores? (Yes/No)
3. Default `Character::portrait_id` preference: empty `""` or legacy `"0"`? (Empty / `"0"`)

Please review and confirm. Once confirmed I will produce an ordered checklist of concrete PR-sized tasks and testing steps for implementation.
