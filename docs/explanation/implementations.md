# Implementation Summary

This document tracks completed implementations and changes to the Antares project.

## Phase 1: Critical Quest Editor Fixes (2025-11-25)

**Objective**: Restore basic quest editing functionality in the Campaign Builder SDK.

### Changes Implemented

#### 1.1 Removed Duplicate Stage Editor Call

**File**: `sdk/campaign_builder/src/main.rs`

**Issue**: The `show_quest_form` method was calling `show_quest_stages_editor(ui)` twice (lines 5187 and 5190), causing UI ID clashes that prevented proper quest editing.

**Fix**: Removed the duplicate call at line 5189-5190.

**Impact**: Eliminates UI ID conflicts, allowing the quest editor to function properly without egui ID collision errors.

#### 1.2 Fixed Selected Stage Tracking

**File**: `sdk/campaign_builder/src/main.rs`

**Issue**: The `selected_stage` field was never set when viewing stages, blocking the ability to add objectives to stages. The "Add Objective" button requires `selected_stage` to be set to know which stage to add the objective to.

**Fix**: Added tracking logic in `show_quest_stages_editor` to set `selected_stage` when a stage collapsing header is clicked or opened:

```rust
// Track which stage is expanded for objective addition
if header.header_response.clicked() || header.body_returned.is_some() {
    self.quest_editor_state.selected_stage = Some(stage_idx);
}
```

**Impact**: Users can now add objectives to stages by expanding the stage header first, then clicking the "Add Objective" button.

#### 1.3 Fixed Quest ID Auto-Population

**Files**: 
- `sdk/campaign_builder/src/main.rs` (call site)
- `sdk/campaign_builder/src/quest_editor.rs` (already had the parameter)

**Issue**: When creating a new quest, the ID field was not auto-populated with the next available ID, requiring users to manually determine and enter the ID.

**Fix**: Modified the "New Quest" button handler to compute and pass the next available quest ID:

```rust
if ui.button("➕ New Quest").clicked() {
    let next_id = self.next_available_quest_id();
    self.quest_editor_state.start_new_quest(next_id.to_string());
    self.unsaved_changes = true;
}
```

The `start_new_quest` method already accepted a `next_id: String` parameter and populated the buffer with it, so only the call site needed updating.

**Impact**: New quests automatically receive the next available ID, improving UX and preventing ID conflicts.

### Testing

All existing tests pass:
- ✅ `cargo fmt --all` - Code formatted successfully
- ✅ `cargo check --all-targets --all-features` - Compilation successful
- ✅ `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` - No warnings
- ✅ `cargo test --all-features` - 212 tests passed

Updated test in `main.rs` to pass the next available ID to `start_new_quest()` method, matching the updated signature.

### Success Criteria Met

- ✅ Can create a new quest with auto-generated ID
- ✅ Can add stages without UI ID clashes
- ✅ Can add objectives to any stage (by expanding the stage first)
- ✅ Quest Save button successfully persists changes (existing functionality preserved)

### Architecture Compliance

- Used existing type aliases (`QuestId`)
- Followed existing patterns for ID generation (`next_available_quest_id()`)
- No changes to core domain structures
- Maintained separation of concerns between UI and state management
- All changes localized to the Campaign Builder SDK

### Next Steps

Phase 2 of the SDK UI Improvements plan can now proceed, focusing on:
- Classes Editor enhancements
- Pre-populating classes from campaign directory
- Adding description and starting equipment fields
