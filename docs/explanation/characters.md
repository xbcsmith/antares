## Alignment

Chaotic Evil: The major precepts of this alignment are freedom,
randomness, and woe. Laws and order, kindness, and good deeds are
disdained. life has no value. By promoting chaos and evil, those of this
alignment hope to bring themselves to positions of power, glory, and
prestige in a system ruled by individual caprice and their own whims.

Chaotic Good: While creatures of this alignment view freedom and the
randomness of action as ultimate truths, they likewise place value on life
and the welfare of each individual. Respect for individualism is also great.
By promoting the gods of chaotic good, characters of this alignment seek
to spread their values throughout the world.

Chaotic Neutral: Above respect for life and good, or disregard for life and
promotion of evil, the chaotic neutral places randomness and disorder.
Good and evil are complimentary balance arms. Neither are preferred,
nor must either prevail, for ultimate chaos would then suffer.
Lawful Evil: Creatures of this alignment are great respecters of laws and
strict order, but life, beauty, truth, freedom and the like are held as
valueless, or at least scorned. By adhering to stringent discipline, those of
lawful evil alignment hope to impose their yoke upon the world.

lawful Good: While as strict in their prosecution of law and order,
characters of lawful good alignment follow these precepts to improve the
common weal. Certain freedoms must, of course, be sacrificed in order to
bring order; but truth is of highest value, and life and beauty of great
importance. The benefits of this society are to be brought to all.

lawful Neutral: Those of this alignment view regulation as all-important,
taking a middle road betwixt evil and good. This is because the ultimate
harmony of the world -and the whole of the universe - is considered by
lawful neutral creatures to have its sole hope rest upon law and order. Evil
or good are immaterial beside the determined purpose of bringing all to
predictability and regulation.

Neutral Evil: The neutral evil creature views law and chaos as unnecessary
considerations, for pure evil is all-in-all. Either might be used, but both are
disdained as foolish clutter useless in eventually bringing maximum
evilness to the world.

Neutral Good: Unlike those directly opposite them (neutral evil) in
alignment, creatures of neutral good believe that there must be some
regulation in combination with freedoms if the best is to be brought to the
world - the most beneficial conditions for living things in general and
intelligent creatures in particular.

True Neutral: The "true" neutral looks upon all other alignments as facets
of the system of things. Thus, each aspect - evil and good, chaos and law
- of things must be retained in balance to maintain the status quo; for
things as they are cannot be improved upon except temporarily, and even
then but superficially. Nature will prevail and keep things as they were
meant to be, provided the "wheel" surrounding the hub of nature does
not become unbalanced due to the work of unnatural forces - such as
human and other intelligent creatures interfering with what is meant to be.
